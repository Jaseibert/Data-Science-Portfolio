# Data Science & Software Engineering Portfolio
Portfolio of data science, econometric, and software engineering projects completed for academic and self-learning purposes. Each of the notebooks will take you to an Jupyter NBViewer, and the proceeding link will take you to the Github Repository directly.

## Contents


- ###  Software Engineering

	- [Spaceman3D](https://github.com/Jaseibert/SpaceMan): Spaceman3D is a python package that accomplishes several unique tasks for Python users working within the field of Astrodynamics. The package gives users the ability to parse satellite Two-Line Element (TLE) Data into its Ballistic, Keplerian, and Identifying elements. Beyond, this Spaceman3D uses a Matplotlib 3D plotting toolkit to plot the trajectory and orbit of the satellites relative to the earth `Pip install spaceman3D`. [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/Spaceman3D/)
	
	 - [Federal](https://github.com/Jaseibert/Federal): This is a simple package built on top of pandas datareader to    make it easier to pull in Economic Data from the Federal Reserve in St. Louis's Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) tool. `Pip install Federal`. [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/Federal/). 
	 
	 - [QualtricsAPI](https://github.com/Jaseibert/QualtricsAPI) : Qualtrics is an awesome company that builds software which gives users the ability to collect online data through online surveys. This python package, exists as a wrapper on top of the Qualtrics API. This package's primary goal is to be a super convenient way for python users to ingest, or upload their data from Qualtrics to their development environment, and vice versa. I do want to make point to say this package is not affiliated with Qualtrics, and is an open-source project.
	
- ### Economics & Mathematics

   - [Zipf's Law and US Metro Population Growth](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Jaseibert/Zipfs_Law_Population_Growth/blob/master/Notebook.ipynb) : A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning. [Github](https://github.com/Jaseibert/Zipfs_Law_Population_Growth) 

   - [The Mathematics of the Powerball Lottery](https://github.com/UrbanScientist/1_Mathematical_Understanding_of_Powerball/blob/master/1_Mathematical_Understanding_of_the_Powerball.ipynb): This is the notebook associated with the December, 27th 2018 Urban Scientist Blog Post. Check out the Urban Scientist [www.urbanscientist.cool](https://urbanscientist.cool/articles/18/Mathematics-of-the-Powerball-blog/). 
   
	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib_ 
	
- ### GeoSpatial Analytics

  - [Geospatial and Exploratory Analysis of Starbucks Locations](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Jaseibert/Starbucks_GeoSpatial_Analysis/blob/master/Notebook.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of the Starbuck's Store Directory dataset, with a build of a mapping tool that plots each store within a user-defined city our country. The mapping tool that I use is folium, a python wrapper on Leaflet.js. [Github](https://github.com/Jaseibert/Starbucks_GeoSpatial_Analysis) 
  
  - [Geospatial Presentation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Jaseibert/GeospatialPresentation/blob/master/Geospatial-Analysis-Intro.ipynb): This is the notebook behind my May 15th Greater Evansville Data Science Presentation. It covers several unique geospatial packages in the python ecosystem. [Github](https://github.com/Jaseibert/GeospatialPresentation) 
 
	_Tools: folium, geoPandas, geopy_

- ###  Machine Learning & Data Engineering
	
	- [Working with the Spotify API](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Jaseibert/Spotipy_and_Spotify_API/blob/master/Notebook.ipynb): This repository contains a notebook that explains how to use SpotiPy to gather data from the Spotify API. [Github](https://github.com/Jaseibert/Spotipy_and_Spotify_API) 
	
	- [Spotify Song Prediction](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Jaseibert/Spotify_Song_Predictions/blob/master/Notebook.ipynb): This notebook is the exploration between two Spotify playlists, one filled with songs that are liked, and the other filled with songs that are disliked. These playlists are populated with songs built around the preferences of my beautiful fianc√©. Our goal here will be to use several machine learning algorithms, to predict whether songs will be liked, and which songs will be disliked. [Github](https://github.com/Jaseibert/Spotify_Song_Predictions) 
	
	- [Network Analysis of Game of Thrones Characters](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Jaseibert/Network-Analysis-Game-of-Thrones/blob/master/notebook.ipynb) : This was a fun project where different network theory concepts such as degree and betweenness centrality, along with the pagerank algorithm to analyze the co-occurrence network of Characters within the GOT books. (Datacamp-Based Project) [Github](https://github.com/Jaseibert/Network-Analysis-Game-of-Thrones) 
	
	_Tools: sklearn, Keras, Pandas, Networkx, etc._
