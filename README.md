# Data-Science-Portfolio
Portfolio of data science and econometric projects completed for academic and self-learning purposes. Each of the notebooks will take you to an Jupyter nbviewer, and the proceeding link will take you to the Github Repository directly. 

## Contents

- ### Economics & Network Analysis

	- [Zipf's Law and US Metro Population Growth](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Jaseibert/Zipfs_Law_Population_Growth/blob/master/Notebook.ipynb) : A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning. [Github](https://github.com/Jaseibert/Zipfs_Law_Population_Growth) 
  
  - [Federal (Module)2](https://github.com/Jaseibert/Federal) : This is a simple package built on top of pandas datareader to    make it easier to pull in Economic Data from the Federal Reserve in St. Louis's Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) tool. 

   - [Network Analysis of Game of Thrones Characters](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Jaseibert/Network-Analysis-Game-of-Thrones/blob/master/notebook.ipynb) : This was a fun project where different network theory concepts such as degree and betweenness centrality, along with the pagerank algorithm to analyze the co-occurrence network of Characters within the GOT books. (Datacamp-Based Project) [Github](https://github.com/Jaseibert/Network-Analysis-Game-of-Thrones)
