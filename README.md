# Data Science & Software Engineering Portfolio
Portfolio of data science, econometric, and python package building projects completed for academic and self-learning purposes. Each of the notebooks will take you to an Jupyter NBViewer, and the proceeding link will take you to the Github Repository directly.

## Contents

- ### Economics & Network Analysis

   - [Zipf's Law and US Metro Population Growth](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Jaseibert/Zipfs_Law_Population_Growth/blob/master/Notebook.ipynb) : A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning. [Github](https://github.com/Jaseibert/Zipfs_Law_Population_Growth) 
  
   - [Federal (Module)](https://github.com/Jaseibert/Federal): This is a simple package built on top of pandas datareader to    make it easier to pull in Economic Data from the Federal Reserve in St. Louis's Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) tool. `Pip install Federal`. [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/Federal/). 

   - [Network Analysis of Game of Thrones Characters](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Jaseibert/Network-Analysis-Game-of-Thrones/blob/master/notebook.ipynb) : This was a fun project where different network theory concepts such as degree and betweenness centrality, along with the pagerank algorithm to analyze the co-occurrence network of Characters within the GOT books. (Datacamp-Based Project) [Github](https://github.com/Jaseibert/Network-Analysis-Game-of-Thrones) 
 
	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Networkx_ 

- ### Astrodynamics & Orbital Mechanics

	- [Spaceman3D (Package)](https://github.com/Jaseibert/SpaceMan): Spaceman3D is a python package that accomplishes several unique tasks for Python users working within the field of Astrodynamics. The package gives users the ability to parse satellite Two-Line Element (TLE) Data into its Ballistic, Keplerian, and Identifying elements. Beyond, this Spaceman3D uses a Matplotlib 3D plotting toolkit to plot the trajectory and orbit of the satellites relative to the earth `Pip install spaceman3D`.[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/Spaceman3D/)
	
	_Tools: Numpy_
	
- ### GeoSpatial Analytics

	- [Geospatial and Exploratory Analysis of Starbucks Locations](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Jaseibert/Starbucks_GeoSpatial_Analysis/blob/master/Notebook.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of the Starbuck's Store Directory dataset, with a build of a mapping tool that plots each store within a user-defined city our country. The mapping tool that I use is folium, a python wrapper on Leaflet.js.
  
  - [Geospatial Presentation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Jaseibert/GeospatialPresentation/blob/master/Geospatial-Analysis-Intro.ipynb): This is the notebook behind my May 15th Greater Evansville Data Science Presentation. It covers several unique geospatial packages in the python ecosystem.
 
	_Tools: folium, geoPandas, geopy_

- ###  Machine Learning & Data Engineering
	
	- [Working with the Spotify API](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Jaseibert/Spotipy_and_Spotify_API/blob/master/Notebook.ipynb): This repository contains a notebook that explains how to use the Spotify API to gather data from the Spotify API.
	
	_Tools: sklearn, Keras, Pandas, etc._
	
I also dabble in all other kinds of technology. You can find a general portfolio covering my some of my past work [here](https://jeremyseibert.com).
